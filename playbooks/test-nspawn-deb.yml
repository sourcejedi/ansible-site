# Test nspawns.  Used for network services, so make sure you run them
# in a network namespace.  Example:
#
# cp -av ansible/ jessie/
#
# # Set a network config to be applied to the container whenever it runs.
# # This one works for Fedora.
# #
# cp ansible/roles/sourcejedi.nspawn-on-fedora/example.nspawn \
#    /etc/systemd/nspawn/jessie.nspawn
#
# # Enter container with default settings - use host network
# # (NOTE this also requires DNS setup in etc/resolv.conf,
# #  and I'm not sure what is setting that up when I do this)
# systemd-nspawn -D jessie --settings=no
# cd /ansible
# DIST=jessie
# HOSTNAME=$DIST
#
# # install ansible
# bootstrap/debian $DIST &&
#
# # Double-check ansible dependencies
# ./localhost $HOSTNAME playbooks/all-bootstrap.yml &&
#
# # Prepare system for boot & login, including a DHCP client
# ./localhost $HOSTNAME playbooks/test-nspawn-deb-bootstrap.yml
#
# passwd alan-sysop
# exit
#
# # Boot in separate network namespace
# # DHCP might take 10 seconds or so :(
# systemd-nspawn -D jessie -b --network-veth
# ...
#
# # booted nspawns need to set the hostname for themselves?
# # But Fedora Linux nspawns don't?  I'm still not sure.
# hostnamectl set-hostname jessie
#
# # Now run this playbook
# cd /ansible
# ./localhost jessie playbooks/test-nspawn-deb.yml
