# `lineinfile` is a hack.
# But, we only want to change a couple features.
# Avoid writing the whole file for now.
#
# Upstream examples are commented as e.g. "# ReportPage:".
# We can toggle between "ReportPage: " and "#ReportPage:" without collisions.


# I end up toggling the following choice manually
# depending on whether I'm feeling paranoid
# or wanting to check bandwidth or disk space.
#
# Note, if you disable the control page, then
# `/etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng` will fail, so
# you probably want to `chmod a-x` that as well.

# ... of course this has the problem of not taking effect
# before apt-cacher-ng has already been started...

# Fedora

# In previous experience, trying to use this as a proxy for Fedora
# was very frustrating.  New mirrors would keep popping up that were
# not in fedora_mirrors.  But using this as an origin server instead
# can work.
