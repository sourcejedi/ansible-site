# Tested on Debian 9 "stretch", i.e. borgbackup-1.0.9

# This was taking about 3 minutes, at 40% CPU.
# While the self-report only shows it taking 6 seconds;
# no idea what that is supposed to mean :-(.
# (prune doesn't show any time, but that doesn't account for it)
#
# This is not due to a problem with the FUSE mounts;
# we bypass them.  I double-checked: the per-user dirs alone take 1:45.
# Without prune takes 1:20.
#
# I guess IO load can sometimes be because it forces uncached IO.
# But I wonder why it is doing so much work here, including the CPU...
# It is not chunking; the full chunking took a lot longer (~15 mins).
#
# The logs say two years previous, it managed to complete in 1 or 2
# minutes.
#
# I was thinking it is a function of the number of different snapshots.
#
# The log is a bit confusing, because it doesn't itemize borg_init()
# separately.  borg_init() takes over 10s e.g. on /home/sheena
# I fixed that part, so right now it takes less that 2 minutes :-).
# Acceptable for now.
