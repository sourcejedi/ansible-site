# Don't want rpcbind running.
#
# (Note since NFSv4, NFS does not use rpcbind at all).
#
# Some packages (monitoring-plugins-standard for icinga) recommend it,
# and then Debian will start it.  Protect against this.
#
# For simple idempotence, just mask the service.
#
#
# Debian 8 Jessie also installed rpcbind by default.

# While we're here, maybe we can support Fedora as well. Fedora 25 used to enable rpcbind,
# and not in the way you'd expect from Fedora policy.  Another reason it can be confusing
# is that rpcbind.service is not started at boot; but rpcbind.socket is, which can activate it
# on demand. So we mask the socket unit as well.
