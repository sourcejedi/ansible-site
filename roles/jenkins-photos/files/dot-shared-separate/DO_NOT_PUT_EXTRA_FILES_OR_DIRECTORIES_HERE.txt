DO NOT PUT EXTRA FILES OR DIRECTORIES HERE

You should not see this file, because it is in a hidden directory.

This hidden directory holds the shared directories Photos and Music.

Photos and Music are backed up automatically like everything else.
But if you store a file in this hidden directory and not in Photos or Music,
that file will not be backed up.

Thanks
