# Exclusions:
#
# Nowadays GNOME logs activity and indexes it, that shows up.
#
# Thunderbird has an index for searching messages, which shows up.
# This is due to the size of the blocks borg uses (megabytes?),
# although enabling compression helps a bit.
# We're allowed to drop the index - it will be rebuilt.
#
# Thunderbird also has a "remote settings" DB, like Firefox.
# This is used to update data between package releases.
# It was taking 10MB/day (uncompressed).
#
# On Debian, there may be an icedove profile which is half-migrated
# to thunderbird, but still uses the old location.
#
# Plus, Ubuntu is moving Firefox and Thunderbird to snaps now.
