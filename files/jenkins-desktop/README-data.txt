# jenkins-desktop backup / secondary hard drive

This hard drive includes:

backup/borgbackup - Backups of user files from main drive, using Linux "borgbackup".

And other miscellaneous files, which might be a bit harder to categorize.

(The other files are probably not used regularly.
They are probably not as important to preserve -
unless they are replicas of files whose original has now been lost).
